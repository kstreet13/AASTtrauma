Anaar, Jeremy
what are the main scientific questions for the datasets Jeremy is compiling?
discuss available variables (metadata) in each

first dataset: want patients with severe blunt trauma and NOT those with severe burns. 
Take note of timepoint. 
Some went on to have multiple organ failure: track that, if possible
Exclude controls exposed to endotoxin, keep healthy controls

second dataset: GSE40012
want patients w/ bacterial pneumonia but without any form of virus (viral pneumonia, influenza, etc.)
keep all timepoints, keep track
plan for gender + age adjustment, but won't be first question

third dataset: GSE20346
include bacterial pneumonia (n=6?), note sample day (timepoint)
exclude overlap with previous dataset
exclude those with influenza and influenza vaccine recipients

Main question: Do we see the signature (that we defined) in the groups of patients where we expect it (and not see it where we don't expect it)?

4th dataset: GSE65682
expect some patients to have signature (or not) based on source of infection
exclude anybody with no source listed
Jeremy: might not have source info

5th dataset: GSE33341
exclude mice
this one is complicated
want patients that "only had bacterimia", not "another source"
find info on source of infection

6th dataset: GSE60244
keep those with bacterial pneumonia, exclude viral and viral+bacterial pneumonia
include healthy controls

Jeremy will send spreadsheet with variables, Anaar will annotate with which ones to keep
Ping if no response by Monday

----------
One HC patient was not actually healthy (patient 9)
How much effort would it be to exclude them / re-run analysis?
Anaar has list of figures needed for paper

----------
"Flow chart of which genes to compare to SVS and MMP8:Â  Those that are different at the C timepoint compared to the A timepoint, because the MMP8 signature is not dynamic."
Genes DE between A and C
Genes have to be in same category (early, late, recovery, continuous)
Give Jeremy the trauma data from Partek flow, get it together, do clustering


2024-12-10
----------
keep cranking through list
B/W versions of SC gene pattern plots (line and bar)
MMP8 DE lists

----------
keep cranking through list
MMP8 DE lists

----------
Jeremy analysis update, no big differences between mild and severe injury
Anaar presenting to Cobb and Kushairy(?)
encoded each patient during each time window as either 1 (didn't receive additional immune insult) or 2 (did)
want to control for lactate (rather than injury severity score)
color code PCA plot by bin in previous time window

2025-01-21
----------
Anaar just met with Dr. Cobb
Jeremy's "delta PCA" plot doesn't show much
Jeremy didn't find any DE genes at all in any timepoint
Anaar went through R21 stuff


2025-01-28
----------
Jeremy: new delta PCA plot w/averages
doing DE by timepoint within bins -> nothing is significant


2025-01-28
----------
Jeremy: random intercept model was overfitting, singular for ~25% of genes
sticking with bin-specific 2 timepoint models
Anaar preparing abstract
ran DE in Excel: all samples in a timepoint vs (3) healthy controls
pathways make biological sense
want a line plot showing patterns - up, down, recovery
can run clustering on gene dynamics (fold changes)
Anaar will send count data soon


2025-02-11
----------
updates from my figures showing gene expression patterns over time
hard to compare timepoints to 3 healthy controls AND correct for lactate

Anaar, James, Joseph Cuschieri, Perren Cobb
overview of secondary analysis project
practices may have changed since first paper ("Genomic Storm"), later timepoints may look different
start by using "our list" of genes, see how samples separate by these genes
start with just time 0 samples, see if we see signal of "pro-invasive" signature
"normalize" all datasets from 0-100 (uniform), add zeros for missing genes, combine and cluster


2025-09-23
----------
is it possible that some of the genes we call DE are very lowly expressed?
to do: check the average CPM for DE genes


2025-09-30
----------
Anaar, James
Anaar has annotated version of James's PCA plot showing huge differences between platforms/experiments
James has big table of how each dataset was normalized and if raw data available
"genomic storm" still looks weirdly split
need normalization for single-cell pseudobulk data
